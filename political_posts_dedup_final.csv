Exhibition Annotation: Although rent control has been around since the early 1900s demand for it escalated in the 1970s in response to the inflation caused by the Viet Nam War and OPEC oil embargo. Wages did not keep up with rapidly rising rents and gentrification further reduced the supply of affordable housing. The height of tenant organizing took place during the late 1970s and rent control laws were enacted in over 170 cities mainly in the Northeast and California. The Santa Barbara Tenants Union (SBTU) was founded in 1978 and faculty and students from the nearby University of California campus provided experienced organizers. The SBTU organized tenants and tried to establish a rent control law in Santa Barbara comparable to other California cities notably Berkeley and Santa Monica. Although it lasted approximately ten years three unsuccessful electoral campaigns to vote-in rent control ultimately drained the organization of its human and financial resources. Both Spanish and English versions were produced during the organizationду»s early years.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42275&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42116&style=thumbnail,

Yes. Acquisition Number: / Notes: In June 1976 several thousand school children in South Africa marched against a new policy requiring that Afrikaans become the medium of instruction instead of English. They protested that such a policy would deprive them of fluency in an international language. As the students marched from one school to another to gather more participants the police opened fire without any warning. (Movies such as Cry Freedom and Dry White Season have depicted the incident but with police giving repeated warnings to disperse; the directors have stated that they felt Americans and Europeans would simply not believe that the police fired on children without warning.) The resulting uprising lasted several months and workers joined the students in protests against the regime. It was finally put down by force with over 1000 killed. Many young people fled the country and joined the resistance in exile. 12 year old Hector Pieterson the youngest victim of the Soweto Massacre is memorialized in a now famous black and white photo by Sam Nzima showing a dying Pieterson being carried by a friend Mbuyisa Makhubo accompanied by Hector's sister Antoinette. Although not in this poster the photo appears in many posters.

Exhibition Annotation: Although rent control has been around since the early 1900s demand for it escalated in the 1970s in response to the inflation caused by the Viet Nam War and OPEC oil embargo. Wages did not keep up with rapidly rising rents and gentrification further reduced the supply of affordable housing. The height of tenant organizing took place during the late 1970s and rent control laws were enacted in over 170 cities mainly in the Northeast and California. The Santa Barbara Tenants Union (SBTU) was founded in 1978 and faculty and students from the nearby University of California campus provided experienced organizers. The SBTU organized tenants and tried to establish a rent control law in Santa Barbara comparable to other California cities notably Berkeley and Santa Monica. Although it lasted approximately ten years three unsuccessful electoral campaigns to vote-in rent control ultimately drained the organization of its human and financial resources. Both Spanish and English versions were produced during the organizationду»s early years.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42239&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42080&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: Nestlн© Boycott Every 30 seconds a baby dies from unsafe bottle feeding. Each year ten million infants suffer from severe diarrhea malnutrition and disease because they are not breastfed. Over one million of them die while those who survive often suffer permanent physical and mental damage. From 1977-1984 an international boycott against Nestlн© Products was organized to protest the promotion and sale of infant baby formula to developing nations. Mothers were told that formula was better than breast milk and sufficient ""free samples"" were given to last until the new mothers' own milk dried up. Due to lack of sanitation high illiteracy rates and poverty the necessary preparation conditions and adequate quantity of formula were rarely available. The boycott was the largest non-union consumer boycott in history targeting Swiss-based Nestlн© which has 50% of the market share of the infant formula industry. The boycott was reinstated in 1988 when Nestlн© and others broke their promise to abide by the World Health Organization and is still in effect. The problem is no longer limited to developing nations. It is a pressing issue in the United States as well with welfare families spending as much as 39 percent of their low income on formula.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46411&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46255&style=thumbnail,

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was formed in 1960 by a group of black college students in North Carolina who two months earlier had staged the first sit-in to protest segregation. Sit-ins quickly spread throughout the South as an effective nonviolent direct action. SNCC organized voter registration and demonstrations against segregation all over the South. SNCC played a leading role in the Freedom Rides the 1963 March on Washington Mississippi Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Volunteers from SNCC and from the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) were also instrumental in the early days of the United Farm Workers Movement.

Two organizers with the American Indian Movement (AIM) Paul Skyhorse and Richard Mohawk were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. After a yearlong trial (and more than three years in the Ventura County Jail) the two were acquitted and released. It is believed that the FBI framed Skyhorse and Mohawk as part of the effort to discredit and destroy AIM.

Carol Wells was told that woman in the poster was one of Ernest Hemingway's wives. She is most likely Pauline Marie Pfeiffer (July 22 1895 дус October 1 1951) the second wife of the writer Ernest Hemingway. They were married 1927-1940. Although his first wife Elizabeth Hadley Richardson was also in Paris at this time the photo more strongly resembles Pauline.

Exhibition Annotation: The carnage of World War I дус known as the думWar to End All Warsдуќ дус led to the emergence of a global disarmament movement as activists sought to reverse and eliminate the post-war arms competition they believed would lead to another war. This movement reached its peak when the World Disarmament Conference convened in Geneva in February 1932. That same year renown French graphic designer Jean Carlu founded the Office de Propagande pour la Paix a non-profit agency dedicated to preserving peace in Europe. This was the first poster he produced for the organization. Carlu described how he created the image using the basic structures of cubism: the sphere the triangle and the square. The sharp triangle represents the path of the falling bombs (a shape which is echoed in the photograph of the child) and the sphere is the world threatened by war. He was one of the first to use photographs in posters. Originally this image was intended to be shown at the Union des Artistes Modernes exhibition held on February 4 1932 at the Art Decorative Museum in Paris. However the president of the museum who was already shocked by the photographic work of The Stenberg Brothers and El Lissitzky decided to censor Carlu's poster and withdrew it from the show. The resulting scandal was so tumultuous that the director re-inserted the poster into the show only two days later. The woman in the photomontage was Pauline Marie Pfeiffer (1895 дус1951) the second wife of Ernest Hemingway.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43262&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43142&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: Homefront was one of the many tenants' rights organizations that developed in New York in the 1970s. Tenants representing diverse classes races ages and ethnicities join forces to thwart gigantic rat-villains representing landlords banks and the government (federal state and city). Each rat has dollar signs in their eyes and wears a hat to represent their roles: fedora for the landlord-rat top-hat for the banker-rat and ""Uncle Sam's"" hat for the government-rat who holds a bag of money destined for the military. On the roof as the tenant's money goes up in smoke to various utility companies the bank-rat extracts a red dollar bill with Nelson Rockefeller's face framed by ""United Monopolies of America."" [Rockefeller was governor of New York (1958-1973) and was appointed Gerald Ford's vice-president (1974-1976)] The tenants fight the rats with the weapons at hand including a chair brick hammer sickle axe pickaxe wrench machete saw dynamite and even an iron. Cultural icons and slogans of the time are also present a poster of Che Guevara looks out of one window above the slogan ""Hasta la victoria siempre"" [until the final victory]. A sign stating ""we won't move"" is on another window and a woman atop a defeated rat raises a copy of Mao's ""Little Red Book.""",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43241&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43121&style=thumbnail,

The site was in the middle of a low-income African-American and Latino area. There were large numbers of residents nearby including a trailer park and public facilities such as a school. A freeway also bordered the small industrial site. A year long fight against the Power Plant involved environmental organizations and public interest law firms. The City of Downey also intervened expressing serious concerns about air pollution from the project. The South Gate Mayor and Vice Mayor conducted a hunger strike to protest Nueva Azalea. On March 6 2001 a non-binding advisory referendum was held and the power plant lost by a margin of 2 to 1. The Nueva Azalea project was finally withdrawn on November 5 2001.

(617) 423-6553 Acquisition Number: 1993-171 Notes: Winnie Mandela is one of South Africa's most visible and articulate apartheid foes. For over two decades she was a ""banned"" person in her own country. When not in prison she was frequently under house arrest and prohibited from addressing public gatherings or meeting with more than one person at a time. For 27 1/2 years she endured a forced separation from her husband Nelson Mandela the man most South Africans consider to be their true leader. International outrage forced the South African government to end Winnie`s ""banishment. In 1988 international concern was aroused when a teenager was killed allegedly at the hands of Winnie's young bodyguards. One of the ""bodyguards"" turned out to be a state agent. Nelson Mandela was finally released on 11 February 1990. When Nelson was elected president of South Africa in April 1994 he appointed Winnie Minister of Art and Culture. Nelson represents the moderate position within the African National Congress (ANC) and Winnie represents the grass roots forces.

Anishinabe Ponsford MN Unplug America Stop using and think about what we're losing. Turn out the lights shut off the taps cut off your engines and celebrate your freedom from consumption. October 13th is a day to reflect on ways to achieve sustainability- a plan for taking what we need giving back what we can and leaving the rest to provide for generations to come. It's only one day out of the year but it's the first step towards restoring our land and resources. Just give it a try and if you like it try it again every month. Remember she's your Mother Earth. So give her a break. Consumption and the U.S. The United States is currently the largest energy market in the world and right behind Canada when it comes to per capita consumption. We've gotten used to turning on switches and electrifying everything. From toasters and microwaves to blowdryers and VCR's we've grown accustomed to using energy irresponsibly and in a way that destroys our environment. If we want to insure our own survival and that of future generations we need to start today by thinking about ways to use less and use wisely. [...] Unplug! On October 13 we're going to unplug for a day and learn to live simply. Use as little as you can and think about what you consume. Where does your power come from? Your paper? Your gas? What are the alternatives? There's loads of solar wind and conservation potential out there. Take a day off and think about it the try it again next month. We need to take action and save our resources. Our peoples depend on it today and for the seven generations to come.

Gary Bronson 5.23.68 Acquisition Number: 1995-056 Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law. Exhibition Annotation: Johnsonду»s Baby Powder has nothing to do with the actual Johnson & Johnson product but targets Napalm a syrupy kind of jellied gasoline that showers hundreds of explosive pellets upon impact. Johnson authorized the use of Napalm in 1965 and it was used in Vietnam to burn forests and villages and people without discrimination. It burned through everything at more than 5000 degrees Fahrenheit and it stuck to people and then burned some more sometimes down to the bone. It even burned under waterдуоwater spread it but did not put it out. The child shown in the poster was burned by Napalm. Air Force Lt. Col. John Pratt (retired) used to ""go along on flights"" where napalm was dropped. ""When it goes off it's sort of like dropping gasoline and lighting it at the same time. It covers (the ground) like a fiery blanket burns everything that it hits."" Dow Chemical was the military's sole supplier of Napalm which meant that when its use in the Viet Nam War became controversial Dow was the only corporate target. Anti Dow slogans can be seen in several other anti-Viet Nam war posters.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=47218&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=47007&style=thumbnail,

The painting is 56.81 x 63.94 inches (144.3 x 162.4 cm) displayed in a frame of Whistler's own design and is now owned by the Musн©e d'Orsay in Paris. It occasionally tours worldwide. Although an icon of American art it rarely appears in the United States having toured in 1932-1934 appeared at the National Gallery of Art in 1994 and the Detroit Institute of Arts in 2004. It appeared at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts from June to September 2006. Anna McNeill Whistler posed for the painting while living in London with her son. Several unverifiable stories surround the making of the painting itself; one is that Anna Whistler acted as a replacement for another model who couldn't make the appointment. Another is that Whistler originally envisioned painting the model standing up but that his mother was too uncomfortable to pose standing for an extended period. The work was shown at the 104th Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Art in London (1872) but first came within a hair's breadth of rejection by the Academy. This episode worsened the rift between Whistler and the British art world; Arrangement would be the last painting he would submit for the Academy's approval."" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler's_Mother; being considered for the Masterpieces show Copyright Status: Under copyright; used by CSPG for educational and research purposes only.

He led 800 million in shattering the humiliation of old China in 1949 and then in continuing revolution and beating back exploiters old and new who would enslave the people again. With Mao at the helm China became a beacon and bastion for those everywhere who fight for the future where labor serves the common good and there are no privileged few. Mao proclaimed that communism would ultimately triumph but warned that before then renegades could still seize power from the working class and replace revolution with counter-revolution. After Mao died this happened with the crushing of the four main leaders who followed Mao and stood with the people in making revolution. But the legacy Mao left and the cause he fought for will live on in the struggle of swelling ranks in China and worldwide who are bound to overcome every obstacle and finally banish oppression forever.

Boycotts were invoked against products from Chile and U.S. business institutions that continued to negotiate and trade with Chile. In Stop Wells Fargo Bank Loans to Chile (1979) Malaquн_as Montoya used the bankду»s trademark stagecoach symbol of a romanticized and heroicized U.S. past to call attention to their unheroic financial support of the Chilean military junta. In addition to listing the atrocities committed in Chile this poster promoted direct sanctions against the bank by announcing a думwithdrawal dayдуќ when people would transfer their accounts. In the context of this poster it is important to note that Wells Fargo was one of the few U.S. banks to refuse to do business with South Africa in the 1980s. One can but speculate that the unfavorable public attention directed towards Wells Fargo in the 1970s alerted them to the dangers of continuing to support governments whose abuses attracted wide international attention. [from ""Just Another Poster"" catalogue essay titled ""La Lucha Sigue"" by Carol Wells 2002 Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law; used by CSPG with permission. Exhibition Annotation: Following the 1973 Chilean coup activists called for boycotts of Chilean products and U.S. businesses that continued to trade with Chileду»s military dictatorship. In this poster Malaquн_as Montoya used Wells Fargoду»s trademark stagecoach symbol of a romanticized and heroic U.S. past to call attention to its unheroic financial support of the Chilean military junta. In addition to listing the atrocities committed in Chile the poster promoted direct sanctions against the bank by announcing a думwithdrawal dayдуќ on which date people were asked to transfer their accounts to other institutions. This campaign generated a great deal of negative attention for Wells Fargo and may be one reason the bank agreed to cease doing business with apartheid South Africa in the 1980s.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46337&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46218&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: In November 1973 while incarcerated in a California state prison Ernest Graham and Eugene Allen were charged with killing a correctional officer. Graham's first trial resulted in a mistrial because the jury could not reach a verdict. After his second trial in 1976 Graham was sentenced to death but the California Supreme Court reversed the conviction because prosecutors improperly excluded potential African American jurors. Graham and Allen ""belonged to the group whose members the district attorney had excluded whereas the alleged victim was a member of the group to which [all] of the remaining jurors belong"" (People v. Allen 590 P.2d 30 34 (Cal.1979). Graham's third trial ended in another hung jury and he was acquitted in his fourth trial. The poster shows how the term ""prisoners of war"" has been used to critique racism in the prison system and society as a whole terming prisons a form of war on people of color.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11109&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11109&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11110&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11109&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11110&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11109&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11110&style=thumbnail,

These are just some of the repressive features of SB-1 - other sections deal with the Entrapment* Secrecy* Wiretapping* Contempt of Congress* Obscenity* Civil Rights* Police Force and Theft of Intellectual Property. SB-1 must be scrapped it represents a transfer of power into the hands of a federal government already involved in the mechanizations of repression and already gearing up through the Law Enforcement Assistance Ass. and other police forces for the stormy economic and social climate which they fear might lead the American people to consider radial alternatives. SB-1 must be fought now to wait may be too late for the thousands of people now facing or soon to face trial particularly prison activists. It will certainly be too late for anyone on death row. U.S. Senators should be urged to send S.B.1 back for further hearings to eliminate it's [sic: its] repressive features or oppose it altogether when it comes up for a vote. Representatives should be urged to press for full house hearings on S.B.1's companion bill H.R. 333 which also contains serious repressive features which must be eliminated.

June 28/Day of Solidarity with Gay Struggles Printed and published by Inkworks Press Face by Su Negrin/Times Change Press Acquisition Number: / Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law. Exhibition Annotation: Unite to Fight! commemorates the Stonewall Riots that began on June 28 1969. The Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City was a mafia-owned heterosexual nightclub. In 1966 the owners re-opened it as a gay bar. The age range of the clientнВle was between the upper teens and early thirties and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white black and Hispanic. Despite weekly police payoffs police raids were frequent. But the early morning raid of June 28 1969 was different. People fought back. The Stonewall riots are generally credited with being the first instance in the U.S. that that gays and lesbians fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities and they became the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement in the U.S. and around the world. Unite to Fight! was originally printed in New York NY at Time Change Press circa 1973. Times Change Press was founded in 1970 by Tom Wodetzki and Su Negrin and provided opportunities for artists representing various themes on the political spectrum including anarchist Marxist-Leninist communitarian socialist feminist lesbian and gay. Times Change Press closed in 1974 the same year that Inkworks Press was founded in Berkeley California. Inkworks a democratically run worker collective and a union shop reprinted it in 1976.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=44489&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=44189&style=thumbnail,

Distribution or reproduction beyond that allowed by fair use requires the written permission of the copyright owners. Exhibition Annotation: The slogan Make Love Not War was first used to oppose the Viet Nam War but is still invoked in other anti-war contexts. Gershon Legman (1917 дус1999) a cultural critic and folklorist claimed to be the inventor of the phrase probably circa 1964-1965 when he was a writer in residence at the University of California at San Diego. Radical activists Penelope and Franklin Rosemont were the first to print the slogan when they produced thousands of ""Make Love Not War"" buttons at the Solidarity Bookshop in Chicago Illinois distributing them at the Mother's Day Peace March in 1965. In April 1965 at an anti-Viet Nam War demonstration in Eugene Oregon Diane Newell Meyer a senior at the University of Oregon pinned a handwritten думLet's make love not warдуќ on her sweater. A picture of her was printed in the Eugene Register-Guard and then a related article appeared in the New York Times on May 9 1965. That was the beginning of the popularity of this phrase.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42932&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42350&style=thumbnail,

In this photomontage Klaus Staeck represents the middle class veneer of a capitalist developer with the bowler hat and bow tie yet whose true nature and intentions are evident in the sharp teeth of the steam shovel. Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear....and he shows them pearly white Just a jackknife has MacHeath babe.....and he keeps it out of sight When that shark bites with his teeth dear....scarlet billows start to spread Just a gloved hand has MacHeath babe..and he never shows a single drop of red Line from the song ""Mack the Knife"" Words by Bertolt Brecht and Music by Kurt Weill; English words added by Marc Blitzstein written in 1928 for ""Theme From the Threepenny Opera.""

Of the 1.4 million people treated for non-fatal injuries stemming from acts of violence almost half were injured by someone they knew. And of those about 17% or 234000 people were treated for injuries by someone with whom they had had an intimate relationship.

Exhibition Annotation: In the late 1970s it seemed as if every telephone pole on the east side of Los Angeles was strikingly festooned with bright posters advertising music and dance events in the Latino community. Bia Lowe appropriated that distinctive look for the design of this poster advertising a Lesbian Art Project event. It was initially planned that a crew would get together and plaster the neighborhoods with these posters. But in 1978 this didnду»t feel safe and the organizers didnду»t want to direct potentially hostile strangers to this lesbian dance. So they mocked up one poster put it on a telephone pole photographed it and immediately removed it. The photo became the real poster which was discreetly mailed to an in-house mailing list but it imagines a world in which lesbian events can be announced as publicly as any other cultural event.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=21110&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=21110&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=21111&style=thumbnail,

Must we now die for 6 months of oil? We have learned something about the Arctic in the 20000 years we have lived up here. One must not disturb the place where the caribou go to bear their young even in hard times. Or nothing will remain for future generations. This is a lesson some Washington politicians have not yet learned. Oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge promoted by Chevron Arco and BP will end the way of life that has sustained us for a thousand generations... for six months of oil. How will America survive the next fifty yearslet alone the next thousand years if our leaders keep acting like this? There is a better way and many people in Congress know it. It is to preserve the Porcupine Caribou calving grounds as wilderness... and keep oil drillers out. Contact the real decision makers now. Help protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Help up protect our children and grandchildren. Experience tells us such wisdom will safeguard your children as well. The Gwich'in People Help us save our Arctic way of life. This is an appeal from the Gwich'in chiefs and people of Arctic Village Venetie Chalkytsik Fort Yukon Old Crow Fort McPherson Arctic Red River Aklavik and other traditional communities in northeast Alaska and northwest Canada.

Exhibition Annotation: In this poster the artist references the sun of the Filipino flag designed in 1898. The sun represents the dawning of a new era of self-determination after the Spanish-American war and the U.S. promise of independence (which was not granted until 1946). The 8 rays on the sun stand for the 8 provinces that rose in revolt against Spanish rule in the late 19th century. The 3 stars (on the flag) stand for the 3 principal geographic areas of the country- Luzon the Visayas and Mindanao. The reference further points to the similarities in history between Chicanos and Filipinos not only sharing barrios and struggles today but also sharing a common history.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43240&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=43120&style=thumbnail,

Distribution or reproduction beyond that allowed by fair use requires the written permission of the copyright owners. Exhibition Annotation: This poster opposes giving Elia Kazan a lifetime achievement award at the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles in 1999. Kazan whose films include On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955) created a furor in 1952 when he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). At first he admitted to his own membership in the Communist Party but refused to give the names of others. After four months he changed his mind and identified eight fellow directors and actors as members. Kazan's refusal to apologize for that testimony or for the hardships it caused his friends made him an outcast in many Hollywood circles. The executive council of the Eastern unit of the Writers Guild of America voted to protest against the Academy's decision to present an honorary Oscar to Elia Kazan accusing Kazan of causing irrevocable harm to the lives and careers of several professional colleagues with his HUAC testimony. Approximately 700 protested outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion while inside the audience was divided and many refused to join the standing ovation or applaud. The Oscar used in this poster was awarded for the film Bridge On The River Kwai but withheld from blacklisted screenwriters Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman until after their deaths.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=12107&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11726&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=12107&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=13180&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=12107&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11726&style=thumbnail,

Copyright Status: Public domain. Exhibition Annotation: The first-ever Gay Pride Parade was held in Los Angeles on June 28 1970 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots at the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in New York City. The CSW parade was started by a number of Los Angeles gay activists prominent among them Morris Kight Reverend Troy Perry and Bob Humphries. Although one of several gay pride parades that took place that day around the United States this was the only ""street closing"" gay pride parade held in 1970дуоsomething emulated by the other parades the following year. After several troubled years (no parade was held in 1973) the CSW parade returned in 1974 and originated yet another feature of the modern gay pride movement by adding a festival to its annual event. There was always a tense relationship between CSW the businesses on Hollywood Boulevard and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) so in 1979 the parade and festival were moved to the more friendly environs of Santa Monica Boulevard in the soon-to-be-incorporated (1984) City of West Hollywood. CSW is now celebrated every June in West Hollywood and involves an all-weekend festival. This poster was for the second Christopher Street West Parade held in Los Angeles. No offset printshop was willing to print this poster until organizers contacted Peace Press. A workers' collective founded by anti-Viet Nam War activists in 1967 Peace Press not only printed this poster but were also enthusiastic about printing pamphlets about gay rights when arrested drafted etc.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37499&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37366&style=thumbnail,

He was born in Guanajuato on May 8 1753. On September 16 1810 he rang the bells of the church and gave the famous Grito de Dolores claiming the country's independence and marking the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. Hн_dalgo led a small army of peasants in their struggle for freedom before being captured in 1811.

Exhibition Annotation: On January 1 1994 the day when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) declared war on the Mexican government. The Zapatistas believed that NAFTA would increase the gap between rich and poor and meant death to indigenous peoples in Chiapas the southernmost and one of the poorest states of Mexico. Taking their name from Emiliano Zapata the agrarian reformer and hero of the 1910 Mexican Revolution the Zapatistas see themselves as his ideological heir. They called for greater democratization of the Mexican government and for land reform. Zapatistas wear masks both to hide their identities from the government and to have people focus on their message instead of personalities.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=9318&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=8457&style=thumbnail,

In the 1980s many people mistakenly believed that AIDS afflicted only homosexual men and was even referred to as the ""gay cancer.""

""I'm not against fusion but I am against the irresponsible rushing into anything"" she said at a news conference after the vote. ""I'm saying that at this moment we should pause and not plunge into a new danger such as we did when we moved from the atomic bomb to the hydrogen bomb"" Dr. Mead said.

In this period they exhibited their posters internationally and organized political art shows. Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law. Exhibition Annotation: The forced drugging of inmates is an ongoing problemдуо40% of the inmates and patients given antipsychotic drugs develop long term injuries. One of the most common side effects is tardive dyskinesia which causes loss of bodily control and disfigurement. The drug companies make huge profits with the sale of the drugs and prisons can cut corners by overmedicating inmates rather than finding lasting and rehabilitative alternatives. The forced drugging of people being held in Guantanamo raises further concerns. Prisoners with no history of mental health issues were drugged in what many interpret to be efforts to coerce confessions.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45470&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45448&style=thumbnail,

The continuing purpose of the festival is to visibly demonstrate that we have here a community worth preserving and that the canals themselves constitute a public recreational resource that should not be taken from the people. On the day of the festival we want our neighbors to see who we are what we do and to share the pleasures of the canals with us. The purpose of the festival is not to sell commercially-made wares or to make money but to celebrate our community and to share what we ourselves do and make. We invite all artists craftspeople performers cooks organizations and individuals who live in Venice to join us again in celebration. We invite people to have a good time and to help save an endangered species -- the residents of Venice. for information call 823.74.52 or 821.71.13 Acquisition Number: 1999-117 Copyright Status: Public domain.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37594&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37413&style=thumbnail,

MR Eugene Debs Acquisition Number: 1994-153 Notes: Eugene Victor Debs (1855-1926) was born to French parents in Terre Haute Indiana where his father ran a small grocery store. At age 15 he went to work on the railroads. After serving as secretary of his local of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (1875-80) he became the union's national secretary and editor of its magazine (1880-92). He then served in the Indiana legislature from 1886 to 1888. Championing the cause of industrial unionism he organized the American Railway Union in 1892 and led the boycott of all Pullman cars during the great strike of 1894; for defying the government's injunction he was jailed for six months. Converting to socialism while in jail he helped found the Social Democratic Party in 1897 which merged in 1901 with another group to form the Socialist Party (SP). In 1905 he helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (also known as the IWW or Wobblies) which he eventually disavowed because of its use of violence. He ran for the U.S. presidency in 1900 1904 1908 and 1912 as the SP's candidate winning over 900000 votes 6% of the total cast in the 1912 election. During these years he supported himself by lecturing and writing. In 1918 he spoke out against the trials being conducted under the 1917 Espionage Act under which individuals opposed to America participating in the world war were being charged with sedition; he himself was then tried for sedition and sentenced to ten years in jail. While in jail in 1920 he again ran for president on the Socialist ticket; he received his largest vote ever. Public protest persuaded President Harding to release him in 1921 but Debs never ceased working for the cause of Socialism. He died on October 20 1926.

On May 4 1886 at a peaceful rally protesting the wanton killing of strikers from the McCormick Works by police a bomb was exploded wounding sixty-seven cops and killing seven. Within twenty-four hours several thousand unionists were arrested and held in jail for days while the ruling class prepared its revenge. Though the State offered no evidence of direct implication in the bombing five anarchists were sentenced to death by hanging. Louis Lingg the only one that the prosection could prove ever made a bomb killed himself in his cell. The other four after appeals were denied were executed at Noon on November 11 1887.

People began to rebel against these conditions. So as to maintain order and produce a healthier and more skilled workforce private philanthropists (charity workers) and the Victorian State began to intervene. Central to this intervention was the creation of the modern family using the existing middle class family as the model. They used a combination of moral legal medical and educational methods and reforms. One of the most important concerns was the crusade against infant mortality and measures were introduced which aimed to ensure the healthy upbringing of children. The wife and the mother became the central focus for these policies. In this way the state began to regulate the way that women performed unpaid work in the private world of the family in order to service and maintain the paid workforce.

At sixteen she took part in the Fink Cigar Strike and in her early twenties she was a key force in the Pecan Shellers' strike both in Texas. In 1936 pecan shellers worked in sweatshops earning from 5Њў to 6Њў a pound. Conditions forced workers to organize. When management cut rates by 1Њў a pound thousands of shellers walked off their jobs on February 1 1938 at the peak of the pecan shelling season. Over 1000 pickets were arrested and tear gas was repeatedly used to disperse the crowds. Emma Tenayucca worked for the Workers Alliance organizing the unemployed. A member of the Communist Party she led demonstrations attracting 10000 participants. Tenayucca was called ""La Pasionaria"" by her supporters (after Dolores Ibarrui communist leader of the Spanish Civil War). A power struggle over control of the strike developed between Tenayucca and the CIO's United Cannery Agricultural Packing and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA). To remove charges of communist influence she was forced to resign her leadership role on the second day of the strike although the workers subsequently voted her honorary strike leader. The Catholic Church the Mexican Chamber of Commerce and the League of United Latin American Citizens refused to support the pecan strike. Strikers were beaten and Mexicans were forced to become scabs under the threat of deportation. A soup kitchen providing free food to strikers was closed due to alleged health violations. After 37 days the parties submitted to arbitration and as a result the owners were required to pay the minimum wage of 25Њў an hour. The victory was short lived however as owners soon replaced workers with machinery. The U.S. government black-listed Tenayucca for her membership in the Communist Party making it impossible for her to find work. Ironically she supported herself by sewing military uniforms for soldiers during World War II.

Portraits of more women artists [living at the time] frame the painting. Designed in the midst of the second wave feminist movement (1970s) the poster protests the inequality of opportunity and of recognition for women artists.

At issue was a state medical school's affirmative action program that because it required a certain number of minority admissions twice denied entrance to an otherwise qualified white candidate (Allan Bakke). Though the court outlawed quota programs on the grounds that they violated the equal-protection clause of the Constitution of the United States it allowed colleges to use race as a factor in making college admissions decisions.

His early years were marked with poverty hard work and a meager education. In 1910 when the Mexican Revolution broke out he became an important leader in the region. Zapata became a beloved and admired general to the peasants and a feared and hated man to all who stood in his way. In 1911 he developed the Plan de Ayala which proposed many agrarian reforms including returning lost lands to the peasants. His plan was incorporated into the revolutionary goals in 1914. Zapata formed an uneasy alliance with Pancho Villa from the North against Venustiano Carranza. Villa's defeat in 1915 caused Zapata to withdraw from the mountains in Morelos. Zapata was murdered in 1919 by federal troops who pretended to defect from the government's ranks. He and Villa remain symbols of the poor peasants' revolt against the rich and powerful. They were important for the Chicano Movement of the 1960's. The contemporary revolutionary peasant movement in Chiapas also refers back to his demands for agrarian reform by calling themselves ""Zapatistas.""

Because the wastes will be dangerously radioactive for 10000 years or more the government's Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Plan calls for a system of surface markers and monuments to be placed at the site to warn future generations of the risks of the repository's contents.

(See ID 11790; 1740; 2622; 3486) Pictured on the left is John L. Lewis Chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) 1963-66. In 1986 he was first elected to Congress to represent Georgia in the House of Representatives. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was formed in 1960 by a group of black college students in North Carolina who two months earlier had staged the first sit-in to protest segregation. Sit-ins quickly spread throughout the South as an effective nonviolent direct action. SNCC organized voter registration and demonstrations against segregation all over the South. SNCC played a leading role in the Freedom Rides the 1963 March on Washington Mississippi Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Volunteers from SNCC and from the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) were also instrumental in the early days of the United Farm Workers Movement.

Allan Bakke a white man was denied admission to a medical school that had admitted black candidates with weaker academic credentials. Bakke contended that he was a victim of racial discrimination. The Court ruled that Bakke had been illegally denied admission to the medical school but also that medical schools were entitled to consider race as a factor in admissions. The Court thus upheld the general principle of affirmative action while invalidating UC-Davis's quota program for minorities.

In 2002 Africa Forum and Unite the union of textile employees joined forces to demand a boycott the international retailer which operates a global network of 3600 factories and more than 4000 retail shops. Activists charge Gap with encouraging the exploitation of workers in Cambodia Indonesia Bangladesh Lesotho El Salvador and Mexico. Workers gave accounts of working long hours for low pay and facing health hazards and brutal working conditions at factories making Gap products. Tebello a Lesotho garment worker whose family members have become seriously ill as a result of working in a factory supplying Gap said: ""The factory is dusty. We can't escape breathing in the fibers. When we cough if the T-shirt we were working on was made of blue fabric then our mucus would be full of blue fibers."" A Bangladeshi worker employed at a Gap factory in Chitagong recounted physical abuse at her plant. ""If we make simple mistakes they beat us up. I made some small mistakes one time so the supervisor came and slapped my head and pulled my ears. And if we make mistakes they don't pay us for our work."" An Indonesian worker from a Gap plant in north Jakarta described how low wages left employees unable to buy enough to eat. The union accused Gap of systematically driving down wages. ""We want Gap to stop exploiting sweatshop labor around the world"" union organizer Steve Weingarten said. ""We want them to pay a wage that allows a decent standard of living and allow workers to organize unions to improve their conditions in factories."" Research International polled 1500 young urban shoppers in 41 countries and found consumers were prepared to turn a blind eye to ethical malpractices when they involved favorite brands. A study by the UK food industry's Institute of Grocery Distribution found the majority of shoppers were equally unmoved by ethical considerations.

Sit-ins quickly spread throughout the South as an effective nonviolent direct action. SNCC organized voter registration and demonstrations against segregation all over the South. SNCC played a leading role in the Freedom Rides the 1963 March on Washington Mississippi Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Volunteers from SNCC and from the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) were also instrumental in the early days of the United Farm Workers Movement.

Contemporaries were shocked by the думunnaturalдуќ juxtaposition of a nude female with clothed men despite the obvious reference to a famous Giorgione painting in the Louvre. Le Concert ChampнИtre which also contrasts female nudity with men in clothes. Manetду»s work thus functions as an intentional appropriation to make a provocative social point as do the works in this exhibition. Staeckду»s photomontage condemns consumerism and pollution by adding conspicuous consumer objects into the pristine landscape: a still life of Coca-Cola cans replaces Manetду»s clothing and food a contemporary food cooler and a huge shiny Mercedes seemingly embraced by the bather.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6204&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6349&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: Poster design based on the popular orange-and-black думItду»s the Cheeseдуќ advertisements promoting California cheeses. California Proposition 21 known also as Prop 21 was the largest crime-related measure in California history. Passed in March 2000 it increased a variety of criminal penalties for crimes committed by youth and incorporated many youth offenders into the adult criminal justice system. The No on Prop 21 movement opposed spending millions of dollars trying juveniles as adults and locking them up in adult facilities while underfunding education. The proposition received considerable controversy and was subject to vigorous protests by youth and human rights groups but was eventually passed by 62% of the voters. Prop 21 was funded by Governor Pete Wilson Republican (1991-1999) Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Chevron TransAmerica Atlantic Richfield San Diego Gas and Electric and the Union Oil Company of California. At least one of these companies Chevron is known to employ prison labor (no benefits no workplace rights below minimum wage salaries). The California Prison Guards Union gave $2000000 to Governor Gray Davis Democrat (1999-2003) for his 1998 campaign. Since Prop 21 thousands of youth have been transferred into adult court regardless of the circumstances of their cases. It also expanded the number of crimes designated as violent and serious felonies subjecting youth to longer sentencesдуоoften life sentences. Proposition 21 is not limited to violent crime. It turns low-level vandalism into a felony. It requires alleged gang offenders with misdemeanors like stealing candy to serve six months in jail. In February 2001 state Court of Appeal in San Diego invalidated provisions of the law requiring 14 to 17-year-olds to be tried in the adult courts.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11738&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=11738&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=13210&style=thumbnail,

All kinds of change but what we should be concerned with is bringing about change for ourselves: our carnales. Not just carnales of the barrio but (really) of the whole world. Most chicanos are poor and this poverty is the one thing we have in common with the rest of the world. What we also have in common with the rest of the world is that we are all workers. We work in the factories and in the fields. None of us own the factories none of us own the fields; we are only employed there. Some call it employment some call it exploitation. In reality we have very little say in what goes on in this country. Some of us are very angry and want to do something about it. What can we do? Several great men have said that we should unite unite as a working class. This is our strength: our strength lies in our numbers. Alone as one race or culture we are powerless; if not powerless then very limited; but united we are a majority and why shouldn't the majority rule at last it's our destiny. Let us unite as one people. Let us work toward real change; not toward slow and meaningless reform. Let us demand all that is rightfully ours as human beings. United as one class we can change the world.

Acquisition Number: 1996-083 Notes: In 1993 a Californian political group developed the Save Our State Initiative later known as Proposition 187. The initiative proposed to cut all state funding and assistance to all undocumented immigrants. It proposed cutting school funding for undocumented children denying them an education as well as requiring undocumented college students to pay out-of-state fees. The proposal also denied so-called ""illegal immigrants"" the right to obtain any medical attention including prenatal care unless it were an emergency. Proposition 187 received strong opposition by the Latino community and other minorities many religious leaders and community organizations. It provoked student walk-outs from high schools throughout the city and increased racial tensions. The measure was passed in the November 1994 election but is tied up in the State Supreme Court on grounds that it violates the constitutional rights of undocumented immigrants.

Exhibition Annotation: Nestlн© Boycott Every 30 seconds a baby dies from unsafe bottle feeding. Each year ten million infants suffer from severe diarrhea malnutrition and disease because they are not breastfed. Over one million of them die while those who survive often suffer permanent physical and mental damage. From 1977-1984 an international boycott against Nestlн© Products was organized to protest the promotion and sale of infant baby formula to developing nations. Mothers were told that formula was better than breast milk and sufficient ""free samples"" were given to last until the new mothers' own milk dried up. Due to lack of sanitation high illiteracy rates and poverty the necessary preparation conditions and adequate quantity of formula were rarely available. The boycott was the largest non-union consumer boycott in history targeting Swiss-based Nestlн© which has 50% of the market share of the infant formula industry. The boycott was reinstated in 1988 when Nestlн© and others broke their promise to abide by the World Health Organization and is still in effect. The problem is no longer limited to developing nations. It is a pressing issue in the United States as well with welfare families spending as much as 39 percent of their low income on formula.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=44334&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=44112&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: This poster came about by the suggestion of two activist friends of mine Ernesto Colosi and Jose Luis Flores. Although I had done posters earlier about the Vietnam War and the August 29th Moratorium their proposal was very attractive because they intended to fund an off-set production of the piece and proposed a widespread distribution. The other silkscreen prints that I had produced were by hand and limited to 500 to 1000 prints. Because of the escalating nature of the war and the high number of Chicano/Latino youths being lost in the war it was necessary to try to reach as many as possible to oppose it. I especially linked it to the struggle of the Chicana/o people in this country. I felt that it was more important for our young men to be here fighting in their communities for justice. I felt at that time that we had more in common with the Vietnamese people than with those that were sending us to die in a foreign country hence the images of the two cultures -- their hands connecting and symbolizing solidarity. This poster traveled internationally including to Vietnam. It continues to be a very popular image today and has been published numerous times.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=36974&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=36926&style=thumbnail,

In 1974 cabdriver George Aird was murdered in Ventura County California. Two organizers with the American Indian Movement (AIM) Paul Skyhorse and Richard Mohawk were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. After a yearlong trial (and more than three years in the Ventura County Jail) the two were acquitted and released. It is believed that the FBI framed Skyhorse and Mohawk as part of the effort to discredit and destroy AIM.

Exhibition Annotation: During a trip to Cuba in 1974 Linda Lucero met many Puerto Ricans from New York and she was profoundly moved by their efforts for self-determination. Upon returning to La Raza Graphics Center Lucero produced a poster featuring Lolita Lebrн_n (cat. No 36) who led a 1954 attack on the U.S. House of Representatives in order to proclaim Puerto Rican independence. Five congressmen were shot and Lebrн_nдуоalong with three other Puerto Rican nationalistsдуоremained in prison for more than twenty-five years. Lucero produced a second poster featuring Lebrн_n in 1977 and it was reissued a year later. At a time when growing numbers of U.S. activists identified with and supported many liberation movements Lebrн_n epitomized national liberation struggles womenду»s struggles and the struggles of a Spanish-speaking people under U.S. domination. Luceroду»s posters were part of a growing movement within the United States and in Puerto Rico which demanded the Puerto Rican nationalists' freedom and in 1979 President Jimmy Carter unconditionally pardoned Lebrн_n and the three other Puerto Rican prisoners. Lebrн_n epitomized national liberation struggles womenду»s struggles and the struggles of a Spanish-speaking people under U.S. domination.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6034&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6133&style=thumbnail,

Janet Koenig's photomontage transforms the Guggenheim Museum into a space ship. Although the Guggenheim was built in 1956 and thus pre-dates the anti-gentrification movement of the 1970s and 1980s this poster uses wit and humor to criticize the impact of the art scene on the real estate market.

Hitler ""The woman of the future should be at home in her kingdom will not torment herself with fruitless worry about equality will learn to find happiness in the accomplishments of her man and will not disdain to support him by her bravery her willingness to sacrifice and diligence in the field of life allotted to her"" Hitler Hitler boasted that the Nazis would build an empire so strong that it would last a thousand years. It would be based on a strictly ordered society in which all people would have to accept the specific function allotted to them. The Aryan race would rule; Aryan men the producers and fighters for the Fatherland Aryan women the home-makers and mothers-their basic function the production of warrior sons for the nation. (Abortion and birth control were denied to Aryan women while non-Aryans were often forcibly sterilized.) The Nazis called this a return to the 'natural' order of things. Mentally ill people were put to death. Communists socialists trade-unionists homosexuals Christians and others who did not accept the Nazi view of society were killed outright or sent to concentration camps. The 'natural' roles did not apply to non-Aryans-Jews Slavs gipsies and all non-Nordic people. They were regarded as inferior species; millions were slaughtered others worked to death as slaves for the fascist state. ""What the nations can offer in the way of good blood of our type we will take if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them here with us.

Exhibition Annotation: On March 16 1968 U.S. soldiers entered the South Vietnamese village of My Lai on a search and destroy mission though there had been no report of opposing fire. The estimates on the actual number of casualties ranges from 343 to 567 mainly women children and the elderly. Public knowledge of the massacre was suppressed for more than a year by the U.S. government. Word of the massacre did not reach the American public until November 1969 in an article by journalist Seymour Hersh. The My Lai Massacre marked a turning point in the country's acceptance of the war once Ron Haeberle's photo was reproduced in the press and in this widely disseminated poster. The text comes from a televised CBS interview on дум60 Minutesдуќ about My Lai. When Mike Wallace asked Paul Meadlo one of the soldiers who participated in the massacre ""And babies?"" he responded ""and babies."" The Wallace interview was then quoted in the New York Times. The typeface used on the poster was reproduced directly from the New York Times article. The poster was to be sponsored by the Art Workersду» Coalition and New Yorkду»s Museum of Modern Art. When the president of MoMAду»s board of trustees rejected the project the AWC raised the funds to print fifty-thousand copies of the poster which were carried in anti-war protests around the globe. After MoMA declined to have anything to do with the artwork the members of the AWC staged a demonstration at the museum entering the room where Picassoду»s Guernica was displayed to unfurl copies of the poster while reading statements against the Viet Nam War.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42957&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42375&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: In Spring of 1965 after the U.S. Labor Department announced that braceros (immigrant laborers) would be paid $1.40 an hourдуо20Њў to 30Њў an hour more than domestic workersдуоFilipino members of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in the Coachella Valley went on strike and ten days later won equal pay with braceros. A few months later when the Filipinos requested the same guarantee in the San Joaquin Valley growers refused. On September 8 1965 500 Filipino grape pickers in Delano began the strike which changed the face of agriculture in the United States. The strike demands were simple: $1.40 an hour or 25Њў a box. Although organizationally and financially unprepared for a strike the rank and file of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA)дуоa Mexican farm worker organization co-founded by Cesar Chнзvez and Dolores Huerta in 1962дуоvoted on September 16 to join the Filipinos. In 1966 the NFWA and AWOC merged into the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). In the early days the Filipinos were a large group within the union. As the union became more Mexican dominated friction between the two groups increased. Many Filipinos quit the union because they didnду»t feel they had an equal voice. By the time the UFW finally had its first election of officers in 1971 most of the Filipinos in leadership roles had already resigned. Whatever problems may have existed between the Mexicans and the Filipinos in the UFW the Teamsters and the growers were always there to fan the flames.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37646&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37439&style=thumbnail,

Based on the iconic Vitruvian Man a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci representing ideal anatomical proportions the OSPAAAL version transforms the man into a prisoner with an eagle symbol of U.S. Imperialism hovering above him. Leonardoду»s ideal geometric proportions of the circle and square are disrupted by the hanging chains and a list of social problems. This poster challenges the ideological equation of capitalism with personal freedom.

He wistfully begs you to show him You think he's a friend not a louse So remember the debt that you owe him The landlord who lends you his house. Chorus-- So pity the downtrodden landlord With his back so burdened and bent. Respect his gray hairs Don't ask for repairs And don't be behind with the rent! You are able to work for a living And rejoice in your strength and your skill. So try to be kind and forgiving To a man whom a day's work would kill. You are able to talk with your neighbor You can look the whole world in the face But the landlord who ventured to labor Would never survive the disgrace. When thunder clouds gather and darken You can sleep undistrubed in your bed; But the landlord must sit up and harken And shiver and wonder and dread. If you're killed then you'll die in a hurry And you never will know your bad luck But the landlord must sit up and worry ""Has one of my houses been struck?"" When a landlord resorts to eviction Don't think that he does so for spite; He's acting from deepest conviction And what's right after all is what's right. But I see that your hearts are all hardened And I fear I'm appealing in vain; Yet I hope my last plea will be pardoned If I beg on my knees once again.

Henry Wolf There are 90 million cars and 19 million trucks in the U.S. 8 out of 10 families own a car. 48% of the world's cars are in the U.S. (5.8% of the world's population.) U.S. vehicles traveled 1 trillion 125 billion (1125000000) miles in 1970. Equals over 4Њ_ million trips to the moon. Cost of new cars sold in 1969 was 23Њ_ billion dollars. In 1900 4192 new cars were sold. 1920 almost 2 million cars were sold. In 1965 over 9 million cars were sold. 5 people die in a car for every 100000000 miles. 55000 people died in 1970 almost half in collisions with another vehicle. Close to 2 million people have been killed in this century three times the number killed by all U.S. wars. Death rate has been cut in half since 1945. 17 billion dollars yearly are collected from motor vehicle taxes. A quarter of all retail sales are automotive. Almost half of all radios sold are car radios. 89% of travel between cities is made by car. There are 3800000 miles of roads in the U.S. 2400000 are surfaced. In 1945 only half the roadas were surfaced. Texas has 50% more road mileage than California which is second. 82% of commuting workers use the car to get to work. 47% travel between 3 to 10 miles (in central city districts). Over half of all car trips are less than 5 miles. 4 out of 10 car trips are made for visits; more than twice the amount done for business. 77% of all pollution in New York is caused by cars. Carbon monoxide levels in heavy traffic areas in New York are 3 times higher than the danger point. Twice as many cars were scrapped in 1970 than in 1950. 73000 vehicles were abandoned in N.Y.C. in 1970. 50 times as many as in 1960. Average crosstown speed in New York is 8 mph-about the same as a horse and buggy. Copyright Њ© 1972 IDCA International Design Conference in Aspen The Invisible City.

Uitgave: Komitee Zuidlijk Afrika Da Costastraat 88 Amsterdam Tel. 020-18358 Werkgroep Kairos Cornelis Houstmanstraat 17 Utrecht Tel. 030-710614 [on verso:] Program van actie De voortdurende weigering van de blanke minderheidsregimes in Zuidelijk Afrika om een eind te maken aan het systeem van uitbuiting en onderdrukking van de 'niet-blanke' meerderheid van de bevolking in hun land heeft tot een zeer explosieve situatie geleid. Dooreffective druk van de inter-nationale gemeenschap op de blanke regimes kan een belangrijke bijdrage worden geleverd aan het beн‚indigen van deze toestand. Het verplichte wapen-embargo ingesteld door de Verenigde Naties vormt slechts een eerste stap op weg naar een effectieve isolering van Zuid-Afrika. Dit wapen-embargo werd veel te laat ingesteld en heeft daardoor weinig verandering tweeg gebracht.Toen het wapen-embargo werd ingesteld was Zuid-Afrika al in staat om in haar eigen wapenbehoefte te voorzien. Omdat olie ook een strategisch goed is onmisbaar voor het militaire apparaat moet het wapen-embargo worden uitgebreid met een verbod op olieveranties aan Zuid-Afrika. (Zuid-Afrika is niet in staat om in haar eigen oliebehoefte te voorzien.) Een dergelijke olie-embargo heeft tot doel: Њ‡De lekken te dichten in het olie-embargo tegen Rhodesiн‚ waardoor het regime in dit land gedwongen zal worden de onderdrukkingsoorlog te staken. Њ‡De regering van Zuid-Afrika te dwingen om zich terug te trekken uit het buurland Namibiн‚....

The continuing refusal of the white minority regime in Southern Africa to end the system of exploitation and repression of the 'non-white' majority of the population in their country has led to an explosive situation. By effective pressure on the white regimes by the international community an important contribution can be made to further the end of this situation. The obligatory weapons embargo established by the UN is just the first step on the road to an effective isolation of South Africa. This weapons embargo was established much too late and therefore has created little change. When the weapons embargo was established South Africa was already capable of fulfilling its own weapons need. Because oil also is a strategic good irreplaceable for the military apparatus the weapons embargo should be extended with a ban on oil supplies to South Africa (South Africa is not capable of supplying its own needs). Such an oil embargo has as a goal: To stop the leaks in the oil embargo against Rhodesia with the effect that the regime in that country will be forced to stop the repressive war. To force the government of South Africa to retreat from neighbour country Namibia.

U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger with the full support of President Richard Nixon was one of the key architects of the coup. Under the military junta (1973-1990) tens of thousands were arrested tortured killed or disappeared and an estimated 1 million people were forced into exile. International boycotts against Chilean products were started in many countries to protest the coup and the rule of the Pinochet regime.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46345&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46222&style=thumbnail,

However in May of 1972 the RNC voted to move the convention to Miami. The official reason for the move was labor troubles and high costs. (The RNC estimated the move to Miami saved $800000 to $1 million.) However the so-called ITT-Dita Beard scandal earlier that year created an embarrassing situation for the Republicans. Dita Beard was a lobbyist for ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph). On February 29 1972 columnist Jack Anderson disclosed a memo Beard wrote linking the 1971 settlement of a Justice Department anti-trust case against the company with an ITT pledge to contribute $400000 to the San Diego convention effort through its subsidiary Sheraton Corp. of America. The Beard memo to ITT vice president W. R. Merriam dated June 25 1971 discussed the company's ""commitment"" and ""participation in the convention"" and connected it to the anti-trust case. On July 23 1971 the RNC voted to hold the convention in San Diego. The out of court settlement of the anti-trust case was announced July 31 1971. While ITT as well as outgoing Attorney General John Mitchell and incoming Attorney General Richard Kleindienst denied any wrongdoing the Republicans avoided the embarrassing situation by moving the convention out of San Diego.

Alabama's prisons run by George Wallace and his kind are especially brutal and racist in their efforts to destroy the men and women they cage. The reaction to this intensely depressive penal system has been even more intense and courageous organizing effort. In 1972 Alabama prisoners organized into the Inmates for Action (IFA) a group that conducted classes in technical skills politics and self-perception; a group that challenged prison authorities every inch of the way: a group that refused to be degraded and dehumanized. The result has been the recent murders of three IFA leaders the frameup trials of nine others who call themselves the Atmore-Holman Brothers and mass repression against all who identify with the IFA. The Brothers in the face of this repression grow stronger and are continuing and expanding organizing efforts each day. Alabama inmates are on the move.

Exhibition Annotation: MUMIA ABU-JAMAL Mumia Abu-Jamal joined the Philadelphia Black Panthers in 1968 when he was 14 years old. At the age of 15 the Federal Bureau of Investigation-with the help of the Philadelphia Police Department-placed Mumia under surveillance under COINTELPRO amassing a file on him over the next decade that would run to 700 pages. Mumia became Minister of Information for the Philadelphia Panthers. Later he became a journalist and radio commentator. He was known for his support of the activist group MOVE and for his condemnation of the Philadelphia police for their habitual brutality against blacks. He served as president of the Philadelphia Society of Black Journalists and has aired on National Public Radio and National Black Network. Unable to make a living as a conventional journalist because of his controversial views Mumia supported himself by driving a taxicab in Philadelphia. One night in 1981 he spotted a police officer beating and arresting his brother and went to find out what was going on. At that point Mumia's story diverges from that of the police. The police version is that Mumia shot the police officer twice in the head. Mumia maintains that another person in the crowd that gathered shot the officer. Mumia was also shot by police and almost died that night. The main civilian witnesses at the trial were two prostitutes. One changed her description of the assailant several times. The other subsequently stated that she was under pressure by police to testify. Witnesses to support Mumia's version were never called to testify and many inconsistencies were not examined. The prosecutor won a death sentence. Mumia's name is second on the list of death-row prisoners facing the electric chair. Groups such as Amnesty International the PEN American Center and Human Rights Watch have all questioned the fairness of the trial. An international campaign is currently being waged to obtain a new trial.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46967&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=46968&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=18883&style=thumbnail; http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=18884&style=thumbnail,

This silkscreen was presented to attorneys Zack Ledet and George Overton recipients of the first Rose Bird Trial Lawyer and Community Activist of the Year Award. The Killer Race The highlight of this year's presidential campaign is a ""Blood Contest"" between two vile upper-class predators. In one corner the Austin Butcher George W.- 148 lethal injections and counting ""I've never executed an innocent black man"" -Bush. In the other corner the Poll-Driven Chameleon Al- stone-faced silent-in-the-face-of-murder -Gore. Excluded from the spotlight of their fake-debate is crusader Ralph Nader. Nader opposes the death penalty because it discriminates against the poor and minorities it fails to deter and it kills the innocent. DNA evidence now proves that innocent people have been executed by the State. Most of those murdered have been poor and people of color. Abolish State Genocide Now!!! Vote Nader for President This poster is an Art/Law collaboration between poster-maker Doug Minkler and attorney Aram James. It demonstrates the kind of community outreach an elected Public Defender could bring to Santa Clara County. Without the fear of being fired by County Supervisors an elected Public Defender would have the independence to inform people of their constitutional rights and the power to protect citizens against institutional racism police and government abuse.

I guess I've got what they call the ""crime gene"" but in my case most people mistake it for the ""capitalist gene"" so I'm left loose on the streets to do business as usual and everyone just accepts the devastating consequences in much the same way I have come to accept myself.

Two organizers with the American Indian Movement (AIM) Paul Skyhorse and Richard Mohawk were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. After a yearlong trial (and more than three years in the Ventura County Jail) the two were acquitted and released.

Exhibition Annotation: In 1974 cabdriver George Aird was murdered in Ventura County California. Acting on an anonymous tip the FBI arrested Paul Skyhorse and Richard Mohawk two organizers with the American Indian Movement (AIM) and charged them with first degree murder. On May 24 1978 after four years of incarceration Skyhorse and Mohawk were found not guilty. However the apparent frame-up had succeeded; the Southern California AIM was financially devastated by the trial and fractured beyond repair. It is believed that the FBI through its Domestic Counter Intelligence Programs (COINTELPRO) framed Skyhorse and Mohawk as part of the effort to discredit and destroy AIM. COINTELPROs were covert and often illegal operations designed to infiltrate destabilize and destroy organizations that law enforcement and government officials deemed as threats to national security. In the 1940s and 1950s COINTELPROs were directed almost exclusively at the Socialist Workers Party and the Communist Party USA. During the late 1960s the vast majority of COINTELPRO operations were directed against black organizations for the purpose of causing internal dissent and conflicts with other black organizations. They were also directed against the American Indian Movement Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and almost all groups protesting the Viet Nam War.",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37525&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=37379&style=thumbnail,

Who Owes Whom? For most of us raised in the U.S. Northism the unquestioned acceptance of a way of life based on Northern domination of the South is a deeply ingrained habit of mind. While the financial pages of our newspapers frequently carry stories on the debt crisis from the point of view of our banks what do they say about its effects on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the Third World the debt is the single most important issue of the 1980's. To pay or not to pay is an issue of life or death. To them the debt crisis represents the most acute manifestation of the systematic exploitation by the North that has been going on for the past 500 years. The debts were contracted in the 1970's by Third World governments mainly U.S.-supported military dictatorships at the urging of U.S.-based transnational banks seeking profitable investments. Almost all the money was used to benefit the elite; virtually none of it was used to benefit the poor majorities. Fluctuating interest rates tied to U.S. financial policies skyrocketed in the Reagan years when high interest was used to offset corporate tax cuts and to pay for the U.S. arms budget. By 1982 dozens of Third World countries owed more in interest alone than their total export income. Moreover as a result of the export-oriented policies promoted by ""aid"" and corporate investment they found themselves in a desperate situation. They no longer produced what they needed for survival i.e. food for domestic consumption. They were obliged to accept the ""austerity"" conditions imposed by the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund as a requirement for new loans. ""Austerity"" has meant that the people must produce more and more for export while themselves eating less and less. Who should pay the debt? The people who had neither voice in decision-making nor benefit from the loans? Or the wealthy and powerful who made the decisions and reaped the benefits? We offer this South-North map as a symbol of the pressing demand for justice everyday more urgent. The cruel domination of South by North cannot and must not continue.

Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law. Exhibition Annotation: One of the most prominent and influential photojournalists of the late twentieth century Danny Lyon began documenting the civil rights movement in 1964 as a member of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). At a time when photographers were rarely allowed in prisons Lyon photographed seven prisons in the Texas prison system in 1967-68 and published them in ""Conversations With the Dead"" (1971) including the photograph used here. Six years after ""Conversations with the Dead"" was published it was used by the U.S. Justice Department in a massive lawsuit against the Texas prison system. Lyon testified and the pictures were introduced as evidence. The prisoners won the suit and the prison system was temporarily improved. Thirty years later in a 1995 interview by Nan Goldin (Artforum 9/95) Lyon said ""Actually it's supposed to be worse now. Since then the demographics of prisons have just gone the other way; the prison population has quadrupled since I photographed in Texas a generation ago. Still my photographs were used by people who meant well to try to change prison conditions and for a while prison conditions were forced to change.дуќ",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45292&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45291&style=thumbnail,

The underlying causes were overcrowding poor food inadequate medical care rigid censorship and meager visiting rights. Four days after inmates seized control of an exercise yard and took guards as hostages New Yorkду»s Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller ordered state troopers to attack. 43 people died at Attica. Nearly all were killedдуоinmates and hostages alikeдуоwhen state troopers stormed the prison and fired indiscriminately through a thick haze of tear gas. The assault took six minutes. Subsequently the troopers and Attica guards lied about what had happened and resorted to brutal reprisals beating and torturing inmates. In January 2000 a federal judge in Rochester NY awarded $8 million to inmates who were beaten and tortured as well as $4 million for lawyersду» fees.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45473&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45451&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons. An estimated 100 to 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of FGM. In Africa about 92 million girls age 10 years and above are estimated to have undergone FGM and about three million girls are at risk for FGM annually. Procedures are mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and age 15 and occasionally on adult women. In Africa about three million girls are at risk for FGM annually. The practice is most common in the western eastern and north-eastern regions of Africa in some countries in Asia and the Middle East and among certain immigrant communities in North America and Europe.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45528&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=45512&style=thumbnail,

It is int he midst of this struggle that the Canal Festival was created in an effort to demonstrate our determination to preserve the canals and the unique community that thrives here. We are now at a crucial point in this struggle. We begin court action against the threatening project tomorrow September 18. We are in the process of planning a playground to be built by the community. We are preparing an alternative plan for the development of the area following these guidelines: That the canals should be restored to insure the health and safety of the residents but without destroying their basic character as canals and without abridging access to them by the people of Los Angeles. That public land and other funds or resources be used only in such ways as serve public needs. That the plannig of any future developments for the area include the residents of the area at all stages of the planning. Just as today we share our feelings for our community with you we urge you to share our struggle understanding that if the canals are lost it is a loss for us all.

Kissinger was a key architect behind the CIA overthrow of the democratically elected Chilean government of Salvador Allende on September 11 1973. Production Notes: Medium Format slide in *M-1 Copyright Status: Copyright status unknown; may be protected by copyright law. Exhibition Annotation: In the 1970s Henry Kissinger Secretary of State in the Nixon and Ford administrations was closely involved with Operation Condor in the Southern Cone countries of South America (Argentina Chile Uruguay Paraguay Bolivia and Brazil). Operation Condor was a campaign of political repression involving assassination torture and intelligence operations officially implemented in 1975 by the right-wing governments of the Southern Cone. U.S. military and intelligence officials supported and collaborated with Condor as a secret partner or sponsor and provided organizational intelligence financial and technological assistance to the operation. The program aimed to eradicate alleged socialist and communist influence and ideas and to control active or potential opposition movements against the participating governments. Due to its clandestine nature the precise number of deaths directly attributable to Operation Condor is unknown but the death toll is estimated to be over 60000. In the last ten years suits and subpoenas against Kissinger regarding his involvement in Operation Condor have been filed in France Chile Argentina Uruguay and the U.S.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=7354&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=7811&style=thumbnail,

Yokich President and the American Center for International Labor Solidarity American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial Organization [written within circular symbol] [union bug] Acquisition Number: 2000-063 Notes: Frank Kokori General Secretary of the Nigerian oil and gas workers' union NUPENG had been detained without trial by the regime of General Sani Abacha since 1994. In that year a strike by Nigerian oil workers and others was put down by the military regime and a wave of repression against the oil unions and their leaders was unleashed. Upon his release in June 1998 he immediately called for an overhaul of Nigerian politics - and of the Nigerian unions. Milton Dabibi General Secretary of Nigerian oil and gas workers' union PENGASSAN had been held without trial since January 1996. Dabibi's conditions of detention were particularly harsh and he needed medical care upon his release in June 1998. Both unions are affiliated to the 20-million-strong International Federation of Chemical Energy Mine and General Workers' Unions which led a sustained worldwide campaign for Dabibi's and Kokori's release. When Abacha died in June 1998 and his regime fell the ICEM its affiliates and other union internationals immediately asked his successor as Head of State Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar to order Dabibi's and Kokori's release. They were among the first detainees to be freed of about a hundred political prisoners held in Nigerian jails under Abacha.

Women bear the brunt of policies that criminalize poverty being sent to jail and placed on probation for failing to earn enough money to survive. At the same time the safety net has been slashed forcing many women to choose between staying out of jail or feeding their kids. $ 80% of women in prison report incomes of less than $2000 per year in the year before their arrest and 92% report incomes under $10000. $ Since 1980 the percentage of women in prison has increased by more than 275%. $ In 1979 fewer than half of the women in prison were there for non-violent crimes. Today 70% are there for non-violent crimes. Guilty Until Proven Wealthy White collar crime drains $200 billion per year from the US economy while the economic cost of ""street crime"" is less than $5 billion. Finding a white collar criminal in most prisons however would be no small task. Those who can afford high-priced lawyers and witnesses rarely do jail time while those who can't must make do with court appointed attorneys who seldom have the time or resources to defend their clients properly. $ The Savings & Loan frauds have cost US taxpayers at least $125 billion. $ The US now imprisons more than ten times as many drug offenders as it did in 1980 most of them low-level dealers and users. At the same time more than $250 billion in drug profits go through US banks each year while convictions for money laundering are few and far between. art: Nick Jehlen resistant strains maximum security democracy series Acquisition Number: 2012-160 Copyright Status: Under copyright; used by CSPG for educational and research purposes only.

It was the debut operation of Special Weapons and Tacticsдуоaka SWATдуоa previously untested paramilitary unit of the LAPD Metro Squad championed by then inspector and future LAPD chief Daryl Gates. After three hours of shooting more than 5000 rounds of ammunition had been exchanged. Despite this massive scale only four Panthers were shot four SWAT officers seriously injured and no one died. The attack was part of a coordinated nationwide effort to destroy the Panthersдуоjust four days earlier December 4 1969 Fred Hampton deputy chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers was shot to death at point-blank range while he was sleeping during a raid by the Chicago Police Department. Six months after the shootout a jury of both blacks and whites delivered verdicts of not guilty on all charges. It was a short-lived victory as only a few months after the verdict the L.A. Panthers had all but collapsed under the weight of vicious infighting and continued police pressure.

(referenced in this poster) The large red ""X"" refers to houses marked for demolition in the Glebe Estates a suburb of Sydney Australia. The devil ironically refers to the Anglican Church owner of the property since the late 18th century when Sydney was founded as a penal colony. The Glebe Estates includes the historic waterfront area known as ""The Rocks"" where the prisoners first landed. The Glebe Estate had become a low-income working class neighborhood and the Anglican Church decided to sell it. Part of the property was to be used for an expressway that would have obliterated 25000 homes through Glebe and nearby communities including Leichhardt. Expensive homes and shops were planned for ""The Rocks"" area. The Leichhardt Anti-Expressway Committee including politicians and grass roots community members formed to oppose the sale. They were so successful educating residents and organizing demonstrations that the church was embarrassed and stopped the sale. The expressway was never built.

Cuba and Puerto Rico share a strong identification as they were the last remaining colonies of Spain in the Western hemisphere long after the rest of Central and South American gained their independence. Puerto Rico has been a colony of the United States for more than a century. 13 U.S. military bases occupy over one tenth of this small island. 150 of the largest U.S. corporations benefit from extremely favorable customs financial and wage conditions. Meanwhile Puerto Rico remains dependent on U.S. aid. Over half the food needed by the island has to be imported; unemployment is extremely high and two thirds of the population are living below the official poverty line.,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6870&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=6869&style=thumbnail,

Mukund Arts [on verso] The environmental crisis has different causes in different parts of the world. In some nations it is a result of over-development; in others a result of inappropriate development; and in still others a result of under-development. Logically the symptoms of the crisis will vary tremendously around the world: in one area desertification in another contamination of water in yet another energy waste. Throughout the world however there is one clear message--sustainable development is impossible if we are insensitive to our environment. What World Will We Leave This Child? We Can Choose!

Coors a $62 million a year beer industry has long run their brewery along racist and anti-union lines. Eighteen out of twenty-one building trades locals boycott Coors beer for its anti-union practices. Twenty-three separate Chicano organizations boycott Coors beer for its racist policies. Coors and its major subsidiaries are located in the Denver area. Chicanos comprise about 10% of the population in the metropolitan Denver area. The Chicano unemployment rate in Denver is almost twice that of Whites. in 1967 of the total work force at Coors of 1650 only 30 -less than 2% - were Spanish surnamed Throughout the Southwest where Coors beer is widely used there are over 10 million Chicanos. No one Chicano is the sole owner of a Coors Franchise. In 1969 the Equal employment opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a complaint charging that Coors was engaging in unlawful employment practices against Chicanos and Blacks. A Federal Court denied EEOC access to Coors employment records. Nevertheless Coors says that ""it is an Equal opportunity Employer."" Coors Does its own building and construction. It pays its construction workers 20% to 25% less than the prevailing wages in the Denver area. Of the total Chicanos employed at Coors there is only one Chicano working in a professional or supervisory capacity. At Coors subsidiaries of which Golden Choice Dog Food and the Coors porcelain plant are the largest Chicanos make up less than 3% of the work force. In 1970 the American GI Forum asked Coors to let a fact-finding committee of five tour the brewery and inspect their employment records. Coors refused this request. Three years later the request still stands. Here in the San Jose area Coors is the largest selling beer in the Chicano community. Obviously a lot of people are unaware of the racist polices conducted by the Coors family. next time you reach for a cold beer: Bypass Coors!

[on badge] F [on additional badge] I After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933 the Nazis stripped the rights of many minorities and others whom they considered думundesirable.дуќ Jews were the central target of this Nazi Campaign. During the Holocaustдуоthe systematic effort by Adolf Hitlerду»s Nazi Germany to first imprison and then exterminate all European Jews -- the Nazis murdered more than 10 million innocent people including Jews and other думundesirables.дуќ The badges pictured here show some of the different signs and symbols the Nazis used to label the members of so-called undesirable groups. Essentially this labeling system allowed the Nazis to view members of these groups as less than people. These badges of hate helped the Nazis keep track of Jews and others not only in prison camps but also in communities across Nazi-controlled territory. Nazis did not consider those who wore the badges to be individualsдуоthey were only indistinct members of subhuman groups. In the eyes of the Nazis these symbols took away the humanity of the people who wore them. Today the badges serve as a reminder of the terrible power of prejudice.

Exhibition Annotation: KENNETH LOUD HAWK AND RUSSELL REDNER On November 14 1975 American Indian Movement (AIM) activists Kenneth Loud Hawk Russ Redner KaMook Banks Leonard Peltier and Dennis Banks were stopped by state police on a road near Ontario Oregon. After an exchange of gunfire and a motor chase the first three were captured; Peltier and Dennis Banks escaped. Police searched the vehicles and the three were charged with illegal possession of firearms and dynamite. Oregon state police detonated the dynamite before the defendants lawyers were allowed to inspect it; the defendants plead innocent to all charges.

Exhibition Annotation: Buffy Sainte-Marie (born 1941) is an Academy Award-winning Canadian First Nations musician composer visual artist educator and social activist. Many of her protest songs and love songs written as a college student in the early 1960s became huge hits and classics of the era performed by hundreds of other artists including Barbra Streisand Elvis Presley Chet Atkins Janis Joplin Roberta Flack Neil Diamond Tracy Chapman and The Boston Pops Orchestra. Her ""Universal Soldier"" became the anthem of the peace movement. For her very first album she was voted Billboard's Best New Artist. By age 24 she had appeared all over Europe Canada Australia and Asia. She met both huge acclaim and huge misperception from audiences and record companies who expected Pocahontas in fringes and instead were both entertained and educated with their initial dose of Native American reality in the first person. She disappeared suddenly from the mainstream American airwaves during the Lyndon Johnson years as part of a blacklist which affected Eartha Kitt Taj Mahal and a host of other outspoken performers. Her name was included on White House stationery as among those whose music ""deserved to be suppressed"".",http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=4833&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=47989&style=thumbnail,

Exhibition Annotation: On June 23 1967 15000 anti-Viet Nam War demonstrators marched to the Century Plaza Hotel where President Lyndon B. Johnson was speaking. It was the largest anti-war gathering in L.A. history up to that time. The peaceful march made up primarily of students and middle class protesters including children and babies in carriages was attacked and forcibly dispersed by hundreds of nightstick-wielding police on motorcycles. In 1997 on the 30th anniversary of the demonstration the LA Times reported that думthe bloody panicked clash (that ensued between the LAPD and primarily middle class protesters) left an indelible mark on politics protests and police relations. It marked a turning point for Los Angeles a city not known for drawing demonstrators to marches in sizable numbersду_ Johnson rarely campaigned in public again except for appearances at safe places like military bases. Within nine months opposition to the war grew so strong that he shelved his reelection campaign.дуќ,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42951&style=fullsize,http://collection-politicalgraphics.org/mxgis/?kv=42369&style=thumbnail,
